# My Notes
Simple is good, but controllable is best. So instead of using static side framework, 
I just using github + markdowns to manage my personal publicly accessible notes.

#### 2024-09-19n23:39:00 -- Paper Reading
Read paper [Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for NLP](https://github.com/innerNULL
/notes/tree/main/docs/papers/parameter-efficient-transfer-learning-for-nlp). The approach 
is too simple even boring, but seems like it's effective and can help to understand what's 
a basic **adapter**.

Read paper [Unsupervised Extractive Summarization using Pointwise Mutual Information](
https://github.com/innerNULL/notes/tree/main/docs/papers/unsupervised-extractive-
summarization-using-pointwise-putual-information). The style of this paper is similar 
as [Simple Unsupervised Keyphrase Extraction using Sentence Embeddings](https://github.com
/innerNULL/notes/tree/main/docs/papers/simple-unsupervised-keyphras-extraction-using-
sentence-smbeddings): Low resources need, easy to understand and intuitive.

Read paper [Simple Unsupervised Keyphrase Extraction using Sentence Embeddings](
https://github.com/innerNULL/notes/tree/main/docs/papers/simple-unsupervised-keyphrase
-extraction-using-sentence-smbeddings). This is a intuitive and elegant approach 
without depending a lot of resource (labeled data, GPUs, etc).
