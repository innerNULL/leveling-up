# My Leveling-Up
**Simple is good, but controllable is the best**. So instead of using static site framework, 
I just using github + markdowns to manage my personal learning leveling-up.


## Activities
### 2024 Q4
#### 2024-11-02 19:07:00 - Paper Reading
Read paper [Self-Attention with Relative Position Representations](https://github.com/innerNULL/leveling-up/tree/main/docs/paper-note/self-attention-with-relative-position-representations).
This paper is the foundation of understanding how relative position embedding works. Not hard to understand but deserve to read.
#### 2024-10-12 12:37:00 - Paper Reading
Read paper [Large Language Models Are Human-Level Prompt Engineers](https://github.com/innerNULL/leveling-up/tree/main/docs/paper-note/large-language-models-are-human-level-prompt-engineers).
The idea is of auto prompt engineering is interesting, but the use case is kind of limited as it:
* Needs Labeled training data
* Can not optimize prompt in sentence or paragraph level granularity. 

### 2024 Q3
#### 2024-09-19 23:39:00 - Paper Reading
Read paper [Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for NLP](https://github.com/innerNULL/leveling-up/tree/main/docs/paper-note/parameter-efficient-transfer-learning-for-nlp). 
The approach is too simple even boring, but seems like it's effective and can 
help to understand what's a basic **adapter**.

Read paper [Unsupervised Extractive Summarization using Pointwise Mutual Information](https://github.com/innerNULL/leveling-up/tree/main/docs/paper-note/unsupervised-extractive-summarization-using-pointwise-putual-information). 
The style of this paper is similar as [Simple Unsupervised Keyphrase Extraction using Sentence Embeddings](https://github.com/innerNULL/leveling-up/tree/main/docs/paper-note/simple-unsupervised-keyphras-extraction-using-sentence-smbeddings): 
Low resources need, easy to understand and intuitive.

Read paper [Simple Unsupervised Keyphrase Extraction using Sentence Embeddings](https://github.com/innerNULL/leveling-up/tree/main/docs/paper-note/simple-unsupervised-keyphrase-extraction-using-sentence-smbeddings). 
This is a intuitive and elegant approach without depending a lot of resource (labeled data, GPUs, etc).
